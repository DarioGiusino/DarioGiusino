I am a young and passionate developer with a strong background in a wide range of technologies. My main focus revolves around Java and Spring, where I have deepened my knowledge in web and application development.

My key skills include front-end web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and Angular. For the back-end, I specialize in using technologies such as PHP with the Laravel framework, implementing Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectures to ensure clean and well-structured code.

In particular, I have extensive experience with Java, leveraging the Spring framework to create robust and scalable web applications. I have worked with relational databases like MySQL and have proficiency in tools such as Hibernate for data persistence management and Thymeleaf for creating dynamic web pages.
